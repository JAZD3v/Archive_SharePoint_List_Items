# Various Power Automate Flows

+ **Archive_SharePoint_List_Items:** A Power Automate Flow to archive SharePoint list Items/records by copying the items to an archive list then remove them from your main list.
+ **GetCurrentDate:** Work around for Calculated Columns in SharePoint List since they do not have a `Today` or `Now` function. This flow is configured to run everyday and updates a column called Today with the currnet date.
